        This application is a <b>home made console for WildFly</b>. Don't expect too much, it's basically a proof of concept.
        The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/hasalex/ng-fly">github</a> (the name of the
        repository will probably change soon).
    </p>
    <p>
        The current version works with CORS but needs some additional setup :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Disable the authentication of the WildFly Management interface. Because, I don't know to make it work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a reverse proxy between the browser and WildFly Management interface. Because WildFly does not support
            CORS, in version 8.x.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For example, you can setup the mod_proxy module in Apache Httpd 2.4 :
    </p>
    <pre>
Listen 90
&lt;VirtualHost *:90&gt;

    ProxyRequests Off
    RequestHeader unset Origin

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !OPTIONS
    RewriteRule ^/management$ http://localhost:9990/management [P]
    RewriteRule ^/management/(.*)$ http://localhost:9990/management/$1 [P]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} OPTIONS
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1 [R=200,L]
    ProxyPassReverse /management http://localhost:9990/management

    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: &quot;*&quot;
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods &quot;POST, OPTIONS&quot;
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers &quot;content-type&quot;

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>
